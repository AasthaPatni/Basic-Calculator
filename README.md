This is a simple calculator application built using Windows Forms in C#. The application has a user interface with buttons for digits 0-9, arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), decimal point, equals, and clear.

When a digit button is clicked, the corresponding digit is added to the current number displayed in the text box. If the text box already displays a number, the new digit is appended to the end of it.

When an arithmetic operation button is clicked, the current number is stored as the first operand, and the text box is cleared to enter the second operand. The operation is also stored as a string.

When the decimal point button is clicked, a decimal point is added to the current number displayed in the text box.

When the equals button is clicked, the second operand is converted to a double, and the stored operation is performed on the two operands. The result is then displayed in the text box.

When the clear button is clicked, the text box is cleared to enter a new number.

The application also handles the case where the second operand is zero in the division operation, displaying an error message in the text box.

Overall, this is a basic calculator application that demonstrates how to build a user interface and handle user input in C# using Windows Forms.
